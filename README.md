## How To Use

*todo - package with docker, add instructions*

## Ratelimits?

Ratelimiting from Instagram seems to be something which could/will 100% be an issue. During development and testing (so far around an hour or so, with roughly 20 "logins"), I've only came across 1, where I recieved a `Enter code (6 digits) for <my username> (ChallengeChoice.EMAIL):`, however I was also then forced to verify access to my account on my phone via phone number, there is a chance if this happens repeatedly, that Instagram may take action on my account.

If Instagram chose to have an open API, this would allow developers and tinkerers to create more on their platform, using their platform, it's at the point where either way, bot developers (the bad ones) *are* always going to find new ways around restrictions put in place by Instagram.
